/* The players run by the app (D10). Pure, and blind on purpose: every function here gets a View, what one seat could
   know sitting at the table, built by the judge (judge.ts), and answers the one question the judge asked with one of
   the options it offered. Nothing here can see the game itself, so no player run by the app can know more than its
   seat, or do more than it was asked.

   How they think: each one weighs every way the roles could be dealt that fits what it knows ("worlds"), by how well
   each world explains what happened: the laws each government made, what its president and chancellor said they got,
   what investigations were said to show. A liberal then picks governments, votes and targets by those odds. The level
   changes how careful it is, how much it remembers, how much it believes what it hears, and whether it counts the laws
   still in the deck. A fascist knows its team and plays for it, lying about its hand when the truth would give it away;
   Hitler, when he does not know his team, plays like a liberal so he can be elected later. */

 *    worth 1 (0: it does not think about it). It works out how the table would see each way to play the hand, with the

 *  - test: as a liberal president with 1 fascist and 2 liberal laws, how often it tests a chancellor it is unsure of by
